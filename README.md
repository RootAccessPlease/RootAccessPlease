### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dennis!

I am a seasoned web developer with over 7 years of professional experience, coupled with even more time invested on a personal level.

I possess a profound passion for all aspects related to backend development and sysadmin work.

My primary skills revolve around PHP, encompassing both vanilla programming and frameworks such as Symfony and Laravel. In addition, I am adept in Javascript, working with frameworks and libraries like jQuery, Alpine, and Vue.
